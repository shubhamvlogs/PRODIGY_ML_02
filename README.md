# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This project implements K-means clustering algorithm for customer segmentation. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business analytics, helping businesses understand their customers better by grouping them into distinct segments based on similar characteristics.

## Overview

The K-means clustering algorithm is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for clustering data points into a specified number of clusters. In the context of customer segmentation, it can be applied to group customers based on their similarities in various features such as demographic information, purchasing behavior, or engagement patterns.

## Implementation

The implementation involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by cleaning, transforming, and scaling the features if necessary.
2. K-means Clustering: Apply the K-means algorithm to partition the dataset into clusters based on the chosen features.
3. Interpretation: Analyze the resulting clusters to gain insights into customer segments and their characteristics.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/customer-segmentation.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
4. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook containing the implementation:
   ```
   python customer_segmentation.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
   ```

## Example

An example dataset of customer demographic information and purchase history is provided in the `data` directory. The `customer_segmentation.py` script demonstrates how to perform K-means clustering on this dataset to identify distinct customer segments.
